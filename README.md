A web app to display your shoe collection to the internet! 

- Node.JS backend
- Handlebars templating front end
- MongoDB database (also used for sessions implementation)

Most of the backend work is done (I hope), but the front end is still a work in progress

One cool feature I'd like to add is the option to connect a web3 wallet (Metamask, etc) and the ability to buy/sell shoes using crypto.
